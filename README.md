# GoBlock

GoBlock is a simple blockchain implementation in Go (Golang) that utilizes UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output), memory store, Merkle tree, and more.

## Overview

GoBlock is a blockchain project written in Go, featuring various functionalities like transaction handling, block validation, and chain management. It includes components such as UTXO management, Merkle tree implementation, and cryptographic operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with GOblock, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone github.com/Ali-Assar/GoBlock.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directohttps://github.com/Ali-Assar/GoBlock.gitry:

    ```bash
    cd GOblock
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

4. Run the main program:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

## Features

- UTXO Management: GOblock utilizes the UTXO model for handling transactions.
- Memory Store: The project employs an in-memory storage mechanism for blocks and transactions.
- Merkle Tree: Merkle tree implementation is used for efficient verification of block integrity.
- Cryptographic Operations: GOblock employs cryptographic operations for transaction and block validation.
- gRPC Integration: The project uses gRPC for communication between nodes.

## Usage

GOblock can be used for educational purposes, as a basis for building decentralized applications (dApps), or for experimenting with blockchain technology.
